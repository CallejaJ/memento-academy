## System Architecture

The application follows a modern serverless architecture with a focus on type safety and automated background processes.

```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), [React 19](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Interactions**: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Data & Persistence**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL), [Prisma 7](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Communications**: [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) (Email API)
- **DevOps**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for DB health maintenance

## Key Features

### 1. Authentication Context
Centralized authentication state management using React Context and Supabase Auth.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Seamless SSR authentication with `@supabase/ssr`.
- **Auth Modal**: Unified login/signup modal with OAuth and email/password support.
- **Session Persistence**: Automatic token refresh and session management.

### 2. High-Performance Newsletter System
Built with **Next.js Server Actions** for secure, low-latency processing.
- **Data Validation**: Real-time email validation and duplicate checking.
- **Preference Engine**: Personalized content delivery based on user interests.
- **Automated Onboarding**: Instant welcome sequences triggered via the Brevo API.

### 3. Premium Design System
Fully responsive interface designed with a focus on dark-mode aesthetics and fluid micro-interactions.
- **Adaptive Theming**: Seamless switching between Dark and Light modes.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Real-time status updates for user interactions.

### 4. Automated Database Health
Custom **GitHub Actions** workflows ensure the Supabase tier remains active by performing periodic health checks, preventing service pauses during inactivity.

##  Testing Strategy

The project implements a robust automated testing strategy using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, ensuring quality and security across both Frontend and Backend layers.

###  Test Coverage (15 Passing Tests)

#### 1. Frontend Unit Tests (Components)
Located in `components/__tests__/`:
- **AuthModal**: Verifies login/signup form rendering, mode switching, error handling, and password validation.
- **BadgeGrid**: Validates loading states, statistic calculations, and visual distinction between earned/locked badges.

#### 2. Backend Integration Tests (Server Actions & APIs)
Located in `actions/__tests__/` and `app/api/contact/__tests__/`:
- **Newsletter Action**: Simulates DB interactions (Prisma mocks) to verify duplicate handling and subscriber creation.
- **Contact API**: Tests the full API route flow, ensuring emails are sent only when inputs are valid.

###  Security & Validation Tests
We employ **Zod** for strict input validation, verified by dedicated test suites:
- **Email Injection Protection**: Rejects invalid email formats before they reach the database or external APIs.
- **Input Sanitization**: Enforces minimum length requirements on contact forms to prevent spam/abuse.
- **Database Safety**: Tests verify that invalid requests **never** trigger database queries, protecting resources.

Run the full suite with:
```bash
npm run test
```

## 🌍 Localization Workflow

The platform supports full internationalization (i18n) for **English** and **Spanish**, using a hybrid approach of static dictionaries and dynamic routing.

### Structure
- **Routing**: Creating a directory structure `app/[lng]/` where `lng` can be `en` or `es`.
- **Content**:
  - **Component UI**: Uses `translations` objects directly within components for small UI text.
  - **Static Data**: Large content (courses, achievements) is split into separate files (e.g., `courses-data.ts` vs `courses-data-es.ts`).
  - **Client-Side**: Hooks like `useParams` detect the language and serve the correct content instantly.

### Adding New Content
1. **Create the component**: Build the UI structure.
2. **Define translations**: Create an internal `translations` object with `en` and `es` keys.
3. **Propagate `lng`**: Ensure the `lng` prop is passed down from the page level to all child components.
4. **Data Files**: If adding a new course, update both `lib/courses-data.ts` and `lib/courses-data-es.ts`.

## Project Setup

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file with the following parameters:

```env
# Database Connection (Prisma 7 Style)
DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_pooler_url"
DIRECT_URL="your_supabase_direct_url"

# Service Keys
BREVO_API_KEY="xkeysib-..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."
```

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma Client (Required for type safety)
npx prisma generate

# Sync schema with database
npx prisma db pull

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
