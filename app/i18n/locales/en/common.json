        "title": "Web3 & Blockchain",
        "q1": "What's the difference between Web2 and Web3?",
        "a1": "Web2 is the current internet where platforms own your data (Facebook, Google). Web3 is the decentralized internet where you own your data, identity, and assets through blockchain technology.",
        "q2": "Do I need to be technical to understand Web3?",
        "a2": "Not at all! Our courses are designed for absolute beginners. We explain everything in simple terms without requiring any technical background.",
        "q3": "Is blockchain the same as cryptocurrency?",
        "a3": "No. Blockchain is the technology (a decentralized ledger), while cryptocurrency is one application of that technology (digital money). Blockchain can be used for many things beyond currencies."
      },
      "crypto": {
        "title": "Cryptocurrencies",
        "q1": "Is cryptocurrency legal?",
        "a1": "In most countries, yes. However, regulations vary. Some countries have banned it, while others have embraced it. Always check your local laws.",
        "q2": "How do I buy my first cryptocurrency?",
        "a2": "You can use exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. Create an account, verify your identity, and purchase with bank transfer or card. Start with small amounts while learning.",
        "q3": "What's a wallet and do I need one?",
        "a3": "A wallet stores your cryptocurrency. For beginners, exchange wallets are fine. As you learn more, you may want a personal wallet like MetaMask (hot) or Ledger (cold) for better security."
      },
      "cbdc": {
        "title": "CBDCs",
        "q1": "When will the Digital Euro launch?",
        "a1": "The European Central Bank is targeting 2027-2028 for a potential launch. It's currently in the 'preparation phase' after completing the investigation phase in 2023.",
        "q2": "Will CBDCs replace cash?",
        "a2": "Central banks claim CBDCs will complement cash, not replace it. However, many privacy advocates are concerned this could eventually lead to a cashless society.",
        "q3": "Are CBDCs like Bitcoin?",
        "a3": "No. CBDCs are centrally controlled by governments, while Bitcoin is decentralized with no central authority. CBDCs can be censored and monitored; Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous."
      },
      "security": {
        "title": "Security",
        "q1": "How do I spot a crypto scam?",
        "a1": "Red flags: promises of guaranteed returns, pressure to act fast, requests for your seed phrase, unsolicited offers, and projects with anonymous teams. If it sounds too good to be true, it is.",
        "q2": "What should I do if I've been scammed?",
        "a2": "Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible. Document everything, report to authorities and the platform involved, and warn others to prevent more victims.",
        "q3": "Is it safe to keep crypto on an exchange?",
        "a3": "For beginners with small amounts, it's convenient. But 'not your keys, not your crypto' - for larger amounts, use a personal wallet where you control the private keys."
